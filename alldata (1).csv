"The lady, in all cases, should recollect that her horse requires occasional haltings and relaxation.",CollegeEssay_real_4264,Real College Essays,Human-Written,Human
The time occupied in each lesson should be in proportion to the pace and animation in which,CollegeEssay_real_4265,Real College Essays,Human-Written,Human
"it has been performed. If the exercise be varied and highly animated, the horse should rest",CollegeEssay_real_4266,Real College Essays,Human-Written,Human

"he may be made to go through another of the same, or rather less duration, and then be put",CollegeEssay_real_4268,Real College Essays,Human-Written,Human
up for the day. It would be still better to make two halts in the same space of time;--the,CollegeEssay_real_4269,Real College Essays,Human-Written,Human
exercise taken in such a lesson being equal to three hours' moderate work. When the lessons,CollegeEssay_real_4270,Real College Essays,Human-Written,Human
